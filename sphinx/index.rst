Welcome to FairSeldonian Project!
=======================================

With the growing usage of machine learning and artificial intelligence in real lives, 
the need for incorporating mitigation of unethical and unmoral issues in machine learning 
models is rising at an alarming rate. 
This requires us to develop a tool to evaluate and mitigate unfairness in these models 
that would help data scientists in dealing with unfairness in the models they develop. 
Seldonian algorithm is a framework that tackles the problem of regulating the 
undesirable behavior of machine learning algorithms on various real world data and transfers the responsibility of the machine learning to be `fair' or `safe' from user of the algorithm to designer of the algorithm (i.e. at the creation step itself by ML researcher). As part of this project, I worked on the implementing Seldonian algorithm for fairness in machine learning for any generic constraint. In addition, I experimented towards its extensions in terms of optimizing the bounds, making it more efficient.
