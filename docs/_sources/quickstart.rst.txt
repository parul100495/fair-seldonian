Getting Started
===============

This page is a user guide for the developers to quickly
be able to use FairSeldonian Python library in their own project 
or, extending/enhancing the codebase to enhance the framework.

Pre-requisites
---------------
Library pre-requisites

* sklearn - machine learning model implementations like logistic regression.

* matplotlib - visualizations of the plots.

* numpy - handling data.

* pandas - handling data in the form of dataframes.

* ray - for parallelisation of the algorithm.

* torch - for tensors used in the codebase.

Quick start
-----------
The complete code resides in `code` folder.
To run the experiment, you need to amend configurations in `main.py`.


Go to terminal or any IDE and run that file using the following command:

.. code-block::

    python main.py <mode>

The default mode is set as `base`. To understand other modes present in the code, refer to the `Variants` section of this documentation.

Configuration
-------------
The user must setup the following things to make full use of this framework:

- **Configuration of the experiment structure**


Collaboration
-------------
Please feel free to contribute to this code base.
