Problem Statement
=================
We are trying to answer the following research question -

What is the predicted lifespan of a repository, given the github dataset?

Motivation
----------
Big organizations spend a lot of resources and money for hosting their code repositories. 
If they have a large amount unused repositories, in terms of volume, it will be a financial overhead on them. 
So, using our solution, they can easily look for the unused repositories and remove them appropriately. 
This will save them the resources which can be better utilised in something else.
